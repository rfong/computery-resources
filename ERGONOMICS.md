# Physical ergonomics

## Keyboard
Ergonomic keyboards are intensely personal and varied, and no single one will work for everyone. Your best bet is to try printing up some layouts to see what your hands like, and get advice from people with similar use cases and similar types of repetitive strain injury.

As a vim user and touch typist with pinky RSI, minor thumb arthritis, and no wrist issues (yet), I use [light tactile switches](https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile/hako-violet/) on a [crkbd/Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) (split 40% ortholinear keyboard), which makes great use of layers and has an exceptionally comfortable thumb layout that lets you transfer a lot of traditional pinky work to the thumbs.
