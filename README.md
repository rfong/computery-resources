Some favorite computery resources relevant to my interests.

### Context: learning modalities

My preferred learning modalities are text-based, visual, and exploratory, and I tend to not do so well with audio. Any recommendations I make may not necessarily work well for people who prefer audio to text, or who have difficulty with spatial intuition.

I also enjoy foundational theoretical understanding, so this list biases more toward "how/why it works" than "how-to".

# Computer science & related concepts

## Distributed systems

- [_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ (DDIA)](https://dataintensive.net/), Kleppmann, 2017. Fantastic tome full of sick burns, helpful industry case studies, and conceptual frameworks for robustly tailoring data-intensive distributed systems architecture to different scenarios. Accessible but dense; the ideal target reader has past experience in large-scale data engineering or distsys to tie the concepts back to.

### Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)

A data structure that simplifies distributed data storage by guaranteeing eventual consistency. Commonly used for distributed RTC (real-time collaborative) software, multi-device syncing, and robust distributed database replication.

- [CRDT.tech](https://crdt.tech/): Summary and collection of resources for learning about CRDTs.
- [CRDTs: The Hard Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw) is a 70m talk by Kleppmann on how it's easy to satisfy the technical definition of a CRDT, but some reasons it's hard to build ones that satisfy intuitive end-user expectations.

## Computer graphics

- [MIT 6.837 Computer Graphics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/)

### Shaders

Graphics programs optimized for the GPU's rendering pipeline for high real-time performance.

- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/): an interactive, explorable, online introduction to writing (and more importantly, _thinking in_) shaders. Very mind-bending.
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/): online interactive-coding platform for sharing & previewing shaders. Fantastic place to get inspired and see how different effects are achieved.

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)

The field of computationally making inferences about _natural language_, that is, language generated by humans for humans.

- [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/): written by the authors of the popular `nltk` Python module for doing NLP. Very hands-on walkthrough to common statistical NLP operations through `nltk` features.
- [MIT 6.864](https://www.mit.edu/~jda/teaching/6.864/sp20/) (Advanced Natural Language Processing). I originally took it in 2011, when it was a purely statistical and supervised-learning based field in the era before RNNs gained widespread utility, so it's expanded a bit recently.

## Algorithms

- _Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd ed._ (1989), better known as [CLRS](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) after the initials of its authors. Canonical classic CS textbook.
- USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) [training resources](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=training). I grew up on these and my interest in computer science probably began here. Great hands-on approach to thinking about clever algorithmic design and performance optimization, through the allegory of cows.

# Software engineering

## Observability (o11y)

Software observability is the ability to answer unknown-unknowns, or to derive understanding about systems too complex for humans to fully understand, through making dynamic inquiries and empirical observations about that system's behavior/state.

As far as I know, this term was pioneered by [Honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io), which is also my former employer and my absolute favorite tool for asking complex questions of complex software systems. It achieves this through high-cardinality query performance over extremely large bodies of structured timestamped log data and discoverable persistent queries.

Observability is extremely distinct from _monitoring_, in which complex bodies of data are (lossily) pre-aggregated to answer known-unknowns.

## Systematic debugging

- ["Computers Can Be Understood" (Nelson Elhage)](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/)

## Design philosophy

[Small Sharp Tools | Brandur](https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools)
> the idea of building minimalist, composable programs that worked in concert to a degree of effectiveness that was more than the sum of their parts

[Local-first software | Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)

## Webassembly

- [Lin Clark's intro to WASM](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/)

- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/): a subset of Golang designed to be run on embedded systems or in WebAssembly

## Rust (2010)

## Clojure (2007)

Released 2007.

An expressive functional language that runs on the JVM and has built-in concurrency and immutable data structures. Was specifically created to address frustrations with the weaknesses of OOP (object-oriented programming) in dealing with concurrent programming.

- [_The Joy of Clojure_](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition), Michael Fogus & Chris Hauser, 2014. A Socratic exploration of the reasoning behind Clojure's design paradigms and idiomatic usage, and how to think in Clojure.
- [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/), invoked as `lein`, is a commonly used Clojure project manager that helps you manage dependencies, run tests, package your project, etc.
- [`lein` quickstart by BraveClojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/), with bonus explanation of how Clojure utilizes the JVM
