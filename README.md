Some favorite computery resources relevant to my interests.

### Context: learning modalities

My preferred learning modalities are text-based, visual, and exploratory, and I tend to not do so well with audio. Any recommendations I make may not necessarily work well for people who prefer audio to text, or who have difficulty with spatial intuition.

I also enjoy foundational theoretical understanding, so this list biases more toward "how/why it works" than "how-to".
