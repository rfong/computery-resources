Some recommended computery resources.

### Before you dig in: do our preferred learning modalities match up?

My resource recommendations may **not** be great if:
- you prefer audio lectures to reading
- you have difficulty with spatial intuition (I have excellent spatial intuition so this is a blindspot for me)
- when learning something for the first time, you don't need a complete explanation / don't want to dive many architectural layers deep under the hood to understand exactly why it works that way

I prefer textbooks, written articles, diagrams, and interactives. I have a really hard time absorbing info through audio lectures. I also prefer establishing foundational understanding over gratuitous short-term payoffs, so I tend to go for resources that are very thorough.
