# Corpora & datasets

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)

- [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/): a richly-annotated lexical database of the English language. Indispensable for semantic disambiguation between homonymic word senses.
- Unix standard file of English dictionary words: `/usr/share/dict/words` or `/usr/dict/words`. Indispensable for quick hacks.
- [Phoible](https://phoible.github.io/): a structured dataset of phonemic inventories for 3000+ human dialects, with detailed phonetic classification metadata.

## Computational geometry

- [Shapenet](https://shapenet.org/): a very large, richly-annotated dataset of 3D shapes. (Word of warning: Last time I used it, there were occasional typos in the metadata which I had to resolve programmatically or manually.)
